Before Running:
Install Libraries:
code


Bash
"pip install python-telegram-bot~=20.0 pymongo python-dotenv aiohttp bso"

Set up .env file: Create a .env file in your project's root directory and fill in your API keys and admin IDs as shown in the config.py section.
MongoDB: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible (or use a MongoDB Atlas connection string). The MONGO_URI in your .env file should point to it. The database name used in the code is earning_bot.
GP Links API Key: Make sure your GPLINKS_API_KEY is correct. The gplinks_api.py assumes a specific API structure (https://gplinks.in/api?api=<KEY>&url=<URL>). Double-check the official GP Links API documentation to ensure this URL and response parsing are accurate.
Admin IDs: Replace the placeholder ADMIN_IDS in the .env file with your actual Telegram user ID(s) to access the /admin command.
How to Run:
